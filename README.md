<h1>Description</h1>
  This application delivers the lists of files and folders from the Node's response that is the server, and it read directory from a specific location. When the client-side received click events, the React requests the file or folder data from the node. If the request is a file, the client gets the file's text data and show it to encoded data by the Google Prettify. Otherwise, Clicking the folder requests subfolder's data and appends the data into the original array.
