<h1>Description</h1>
  Built a single page application project developed with React, Node, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. It shows descriptions of my personal information, case-studied projects, blog, and Cloud Storage. The project data is stored in MongoDB, and it is controlled as the Schema model in Nodejs. The blog page also stores the data into the PostgreSQL service. The built server gets data from SQL and NoSQL. Then, it sends the lists of the name, image address and description for the project but also the title, author, and contents for the blog to React components. Then, the client saved project data into the redux store. For the study, the CSS styles built with multiple libraries are SCSS and styled-components. The animations are implemented with React-Transition and React-Revel libraries.

<h2>You can clone this project but you can't execute it perfectly</h2>
  
For the protection of my MongoDB and PostgreSQL service, I didn't upload the .env and config files. Thus, there would be assured some errors when you execute the server side codes.

<h2>In the project directory, you can run</h2>

**Note: I recommend using only one of yarn and npm for avoiding the unexpected collision!**

### `git clone <http clone url>` 
clone this project<br/>

### `yarn` or `npm`
for installation node-modules.<br/>

### `yarn server` or `npm server`
**Note: It can't be executed, because of missing essential files!**
It will execute the nodemon command with babel-node to start the server. 
you can look up the [package.json](https://github.com/wlee2/CodeViewer/blob/master/package.json) file!<br/>

### `yarn start` or `npm start`
demo start.<br/>

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
